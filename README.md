Installation

if you have bower installed then install first using following command

npm install -g bower

After that clone/download source code , you have to run bower install from public folder which will install front-end dependency libraries.

Now, run the command from root folder : sudo npm install.

then run: node server.js

now type in your browser : http://localhost:3000/

Thanks
